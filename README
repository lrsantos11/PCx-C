To install PCx on a Unix system, download the file
PCx.tar.gz and place it in its own subdirectory (referred to
henceforth as the "working directory"). From the working directory,
uncompress by typing

gunzip PCx.tar.gz

and un-tar by typing

tar xvf PCx.tar

The subdirectories SRC/, DOC/, MAKEARCH/, Ng-Peyton/, and mps/
will be created, together with this README file, a COPYRIGHT statement,
and a sample parameter specifications file named "PCx.specs".
To create the executable "PCx" in the working directory, type 

build

=======================================================================

We have tested this procedure on the following architectures:

sun4-class workstations running SunOS;
UltraSparc workstation running Solaris 2.x;
SGI workstations running IRIX 5.3 and 6.4;
HP-9000 workstations;
Pentium PC running Linux;
IBM RS6000 workstations.

Unfortunately, the build procedure is site-specific as well as 
architecture-specific, particularly since it involves linking of 
Fortran and C source files, so there are no guarantees that it will 
work on your machine, even if you have one of the systems mentioned 
above. If the "build" fails on your machine, you can download an 
executable from the PCx web site for each of the architectures above. 
See the PCx home page for details.

Some linkers might issue a warning that there are two main-functions, 
chances are that this warning can be safely ignored and the executable 
will be fully functional.

If your compiler does not compile the PCx code correctly, try removing
the reference to nullmain.o in the file SRC/Makefile.  Some compilers
seem need this null routine in the linking process. 

If you are having difficulty compiling the file timers.c, it is
possible to turn off the timing routines.  Simply change the file
SRC/Makefile.  Change the line

CFLAGS = -O -D$(PCx_ARCH)

to 

CFLAGS = -O -D$(PCx_ARCH) -DNO_TIMING

To test PCx on one of the input files in the subdirectory "mps/", type

PCx afiro

or

PCx greenbeb

A User Manual is available in the subdirectory DOC.
